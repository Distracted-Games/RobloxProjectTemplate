# OtherScripts

This folder is provided as a sandbox for **your own experimentation and testing**. It is not part of the Rojo sync configuration and does not contain any files by default.

## üß™ Purpose

Use this folder to:

- Prototype new ideas or gameplay mechanics
- Try out scripting patterns before integrating them into synced services
- Store temporary or reference scripts for personal use
- Compare versions of scripts side-by-side using VS Code's "Compare Selected" feature

> üí° Tip: To compare a script in `OtherScripts` with one in your synced setup, select both files in the Explorer, right-click, and choose **Compare Selected**. This is especially useful for reviewing changes or testing alternate implementations.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- This folder is **excluded from Rojo sync** by default.
- It is listed in `.gitignore` but commented out, allowing you to opt in or out of version control.
- Scripts placed here are **not expected to be stable, documented, or production-ready**.

## üì¶ Looking for Reusable Modules?

If you're looking for reusable, documented scripts intended for public use, check out the [`PublicModules`](../PublicModules) folder instead.

Feel free to use this space however best supports your workflow. It's here to give you flexibility without cluttering your synced project structure.
